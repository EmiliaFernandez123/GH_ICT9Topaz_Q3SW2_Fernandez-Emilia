        <td> Frozen is movie directed by Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck, it revolves around two sisters. Elsa, one with ice powers, and her sister Anna who she's unfortunately cursed when they were young children. The movie showcases how Elsa come sto terms with her strong powers, and how the bond between family and sisters are able to help you in self-stability, which I think is an incredible message to young kids watching.

        <td>Hotel Transylvania, a movie directed by Genndy Tartakovsky, is a second movie from the first version of Hotel Transylvania. This movie now revolves around the plot of Dracula's acceptance of humans, but yet is faced with the concern that his grandson maybe be a human. This in itself showcases that Dracula still isn't fully accepting of humans coinciding with monsters, steming from his father which later appears in the movie. The slow acceptance of humanity in his grandson and his father's great grandson is what makes this movie heart-warming to me.
